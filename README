Beditd -- Binary file editor inspired by DOS edit

usage:

beditd [-e <encoding>] [<file> [<width>]]

Beditd is a binary file editor where each byte in the file is represented by a
character on the screen. It is not a hex editor or a text editor. It requires a
UTF-8 terminal.

Users can navigate the file and insert text much as they would in a text editor.
Arbitary byte values can also be inserted in either hex or decimal.

Function keys control the editor, these are listed at the bottom along with the
byte value at the cursor and the current location in the file.

The default symbol set is based on (but not identical to) MS DOS code page 437.
Alternatively the user may specify a single-byte ASCII-based encoding supported
by iconv and the editor will use it to generate a symbol set.
